📝 Text Summarizer using NLTK & Gradio
This project is a simple yet effective text summarizer built using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for natural language processing and Gradio for creating an interactive web interface. The application allows users to input a block of text and receive a concise summary, helping to extract the most relevant information quickly and efficiently.

🚀 Features
📚 Summarizes large blocks of text

⚙️ Based on extractive summarization using NLP techniques

🖥️ User-friendly web interface built with Gradio

🔍 Uses sentence ranking and word frequency for summary generation

💡 Lightweight and easy to use

🔧 How It Works
This summarizer uses an extractive method to identify and return the most important sentences in the text. The logic is based on the frequency of important words and how often they appear in each sentence.

Steps Involved:
Text Cleaning – The input text is cleaned and tokenized into sentences and words.

Stopword Removal – Common English stopwords are filtered out.

Word Frequency Table – A frequency table of the remaining words is created.

Sentence Scoring – Each sentence is scored based on the word frequencies of the words it contains.

Thresholding – Sentences scoring above a calculated threshold are selected for the final summary.

Display Summary – The selected sentences are combined and displayed via the Gradio interface.

🧠 Tech Stack
Python

NLTK – Natural Language Toolkit (tokenization, stopwords, frequency analysis)

Gradio – For building the interactive UI

📌 Future Improvements
Add support for abstractive summarization (e.g., using transformers)

Allow summary length customization

Add language support beyond English

Export summary as PDF or text file
